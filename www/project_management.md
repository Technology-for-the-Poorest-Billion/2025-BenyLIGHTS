# Project Management

## Overview
This project was made up of several smaller tasks, requested by our supervisor, Noam.
- Finalising selection of PCB circuitry
- Creating user interface code
- Creating a light diffuser for the LEDs
- Creating a protective case

## Division of team
Given the project's natural divisibility into electrical and mechanical components, we felt early on as a team that it would be sensible to specialise within our team, based on individual competencies. To begin with, this meant that Lucy focused on learning the complexities of the electrical diagrams, given her electronics background, while Samuel and Leo began to think about case design and Jim worked on assembly of the PCBs. Over the course of the project, these specialisations became more defined, with two pairs forming - Lucy and Jim working on the coding of the device, and Samuel and Leo working on the design and printing of the diffuser case.

## Interaction with supervisor
We met up with Noam several times over the course of his project, working around his primary job through weekend meetings. This allowed the electronics team to develop vital skills and overcome stumbling blocks that were more in Noam's area of expertise, and also provided a space for the mechanical team to update Noam on the progress of the case design.

## Management of tasks
Organisation and management of task process was not a highly formalised part of the process, with most individuals having a fairly good idea of what was next on their to do list thanks to small team sizes and the clear list of tasks given to us by our supervisor. The electrical sub-team often worked together in their pair, meaning that their work was simple to coordinate. In contrast, the mechanical sub-team divided work between conceptual design on Solidworks and construction and finalisation using 3D printers and OpenSCAD - since these tasks had less overlap, it was possible for independent work to take place without delay thanks to consistent uploads of relevant files to the GitHub. However, the regular reports and presentations we helpful in keeping the whole team on the same page, and progress was shared on a combined group chat, such that the team felt unified and familiar with each component of the project.

## Recommendations and modifications
#### Recommendations
Were we to repeat this project, we would want to make sure we kept the same positive attitude and team unity that we were blessed with this term. The team felt unified, diligent and sympathetic through the majority of the project, which helped us to consistently work towards team goals productively.
Additionally, the use of GitHub as a file storage location is something that we would choose to employ if given the option again, thanks to the ease of uploads and the availability of past versions.
We would also want to keep the team subdivisions, as this significantly improved our productivity as a group, by reducing learning time for each member of the team while not leaving any team member too isolated in their task.

#### Modifications
If given an opportunity to make changes to our approach from this project, we might consider having a more formalised means of task management, perhaps with a centralised and clear timeline that could be modified in a more controlled way throughout the project. While we had a clear list of tasks from our supervisor, these shifted and were adapted as the project progress in ways that were not always accurately recorded, leading to some grey areas over exact project milestones. If doing the project again, we might include a clear timeline in the GitHub that could record current project aims for absolute clarity throughout the whole project.
