Goals and where applicable with the UNICEF principles for Digital Development. ~500

## Response to a genuine need 
In Ethiopia, daylight hours remain consistent throughout the year. Without sufficient lighting in the evening, people in rural locations are forced to work through the hottest parts of the day, this disproportionately affects women (Solar Lighting in Rural Ethiopia – Ethiopia | UNFCCC). To avoid this, many rely on kerosene lamps that emit harmful black carbon, damaging both health and the environment. There is a typical need for about four hours of light each evening found from **locally gathered data** in line with UNICEFs Principles for Digital Development. Beny LIGHTS offers an affordable light that harnesses the high solar potential of Ethiopia (Mulatu et al.) to charge the light sufficiently to meet the **demands of locals**. This improves living conditions and helps to advance important Sustainable Development Goals such as 3 related to health, 4 education, and 8 economic growth (THE 17 GOALS | Sustainable Development).

## Adding significant value 
Providing light without health compromises offers clear economic benefits with usable evenings freeing up time in the day to pursue other revenue streams. Additionally reduced strain is placed on health services from respiratory based illnesses caused by kerosene lamps. Beny LIGHTS **fills a gap in the current market** due to its low cost and accessibility.

## Availability and affordability 
The lights will be imported as raw materials and manufactured in Ethiopia, this keeps import taxes at category 1 ( up to 10% which is very low for Ethiopia) (‘Income Tax Ethiopia | PDF | Value Added Tax | Tariff’). As well as this, Beny LIGHTS is a not for profit entity, and use of hardware such as the CH32V003 microprocessor enables prices to be kept extremely low. It is estimated that the cost of the lights will be less than 50% of the prices offered by competitors such as D-light that import finished products (D.Light). We have ensured that our contributions have preserved these import tax brackets and low cost materials as part of **understanding the existing ecosystem** (Principles for Digital Development). Manufacturing within Ethiopia also has benefits for repairability of the product since expertise will be available more locally. To add to this, the software used to programme the microprocessor and the cad files for the case are **open source** platforms. This reduces barriers to local engineers and **encourages collaboration** in the manufacture/repair of the product. During the project, specific attention has been placed on ensuring clear documentation that describes the steps taken to achieve the desired functionality. The design of the case is aimed to be very simple with a single printable part that connects with the PCB to enable manufacture in Ethiopia either on mass or smaller scale such as at Makerspace (Social Innovation Atlas – GIG). The manufacturing process for the PCBs is easily scaleable and vacuum forming has also been explored as a potential route for cheaper mass production of the cases such that **sustainable growth and broader adoption** has been anticipated from the start (Principles for Digital Development).The code is well commented with simple phrases that are easily translatable using software such as google translate. 

## Ensuring responsibility in our innovation  
Previous solar lighting solutions have been unsuccessful in providing a long lasting solution, burdening local people with loans and payment plans without infrastructure in place for repair and maintainenance (Ahmed). Beny LIGHTS is a smaller scale affordable solution that is less dependent on prior infrastructure for implementation. Since the materials used in the light such as Lithium ion batteries and composite PCBs are inherently difficult to recycle (Patil et al.), **longevity is key** in limiting the unavoidable consequences at end of life. This has informed the design with an easily accessible battery and modular design meaning failure of the case, battery or board does not result in disposal of the entire unit. Manufacture in Ethiopia means repairing and replacing parts is achievable at worst in Addis Ababa and potentially closer to the user for simple battery/case replacements.

## Concluding
Beny LIGHTS provides affordable, safe, and sustainable lighting for rural Ethiopia by harnessing solar energy and local manufacturing. Our contributions have preserved regulatorary boundaries and the low cost of production whilst boosting functionality. The open-source, modular design we have developed ensures accessibility, repairability, and fits the local ecosystem. This solution improves health, economic opportunities, and supports key Sustainable Development Goals, offering a scalable alternative to harmful kerosene lamps with lasting impact.
