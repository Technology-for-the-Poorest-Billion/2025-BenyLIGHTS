# Index

- Outline key problem
- Introduce solution BenyLIGHTs
- Outline features with links to technical reports

## Features
### Programming
- Button press increases LED brightness in steps
  - Reduced from 100 to 60 to stop browning out (Lucy)
- Button press also shows LED brightness
  - Multichannel ADC (Lucy)
  - Calibration (Jim)
  - batcount (Jim)
  - averaging (Jim)
- Sun detected the LED mode sets back to zero to save energy
  - averaging (Jim)
- Sleep mode when battery voltage drops below 3.2V (Lucy)
  - averaging: issues when battery drops to 0V if bad connection: sleep when it's not supposed to
  - Button interrupt and __WFI()
  - Need extra button for actual useful product (unrealistic to remake PCB in 4 weeks but will feedback to Noam)
  - Currently uses periodic wakeup and standby mode as proof of concept
- Sleep mode after 2 minutes of LED on 0

 ### Mechanical
- Produceable Case
  - Produced design that can easily be 3D printed
  - Produced files accesible to open source software with clear guidelines for modification (`openscad_case`)
- Protective Case
  - Case modified to protect some sensitive components
  - Case shown to be robust
  - Case protects input pins from damage
- Diffusing Case
  - Case shown to reduce intensity of direct light
  - Case shown to improve diffusion of light around a room
  - Case does not significantly undermine effectiveness of battery indicator LEDs

Reflective discussion about the workâ€™s alignment with the Sustainable Development
Goals and where applicable with the UNICEF principles for Digital Development. ~500
