## Beny LIGHTS: Protective and Diffusive Case Design  
**Author:** Leo Mills

### Overview

This section documents the iterative design and modelling of the **Beny LIGHTS** protective case, aimed at shielding electrical components while ensuring effective light diffusion. The design was developed in **SolidWorks** and optimized through successive iterations based on real-world performance tests.

The final version achieved key functional goals:
- **Survived multiple 1-meter drops onto uneven stone surfaces**
- **Provided good light diffusion** through material and geometry
- Maintained compact design for integration with electronics

### Design Notes for Continuation

The part file is **fully parametric**. Future iterations may build on the following features:

- Snap-fit joints with internal retention features
- Ribs for light diffusion (see Sketch4 in `Final_Case.SLDPRT`)
- 2.5 mm thick walls optimized for ABS or PLA
- Assembly clearance for light board and wiring

Future improvements could include:
- **Waterproofing or weather sealing**
- **Hinge/latch system** for easier reusability
- **Smaller internal tolerances** for a tighter fit

### Strengths & Limitations

| Strengths                          | Limitations / Areas to Improve              |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Proven drop resistance             | Not dustproof                               |
| Effective light diffusion          | No built-in fastener or latch               |
| Clean parametric SolidWorks model  | Case could be more compact or modular       |

### Technical Continuation Checklist

- Check tolerances against electronics dimensions
- Adjust rib spacing to modify diffusion pattern
- Consider ventilation slots if using higher-output LEDs
