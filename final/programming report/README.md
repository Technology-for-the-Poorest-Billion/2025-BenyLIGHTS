# Programming Report Structure

This report is structured in the form of a handover document so that Noam or other users can continue with the project and make use of the work that we have done. Within the electrical sub team, our goal for this project was to program the user interface of the product and investigate ways of reducing the power consumption of the device. Myself and Jim worked together on the coding so have divided the explanations between our two final reports. The breakdown of who wrote what is outlined below so each feature is easy to find, but our individual reports are separate for ease of marking.  Our contributions to the project can be divided into 4 key areas:

## Button Press
- White LEDs increase in brightness on button press (Lucy)
- Coloured LEDs display battery voltage on button press (Jim)

## Power Conservation
- Sleep mode implementation (Lucy)
- Choice of interrupt (Lucy)
- Averaging battery voltage for sleep mode (Jim)
- Solar detection (Jim)

## Cost Reduction
- RGB Programmable LED (Lucy)

# Miscellaneous Fixes
- Connector Cable (Jim)
- Hardware Work (Jim)
- Inductor Overheating (Lucy)
- Boards Blown (Lucy)
