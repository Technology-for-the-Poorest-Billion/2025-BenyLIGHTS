# Problem description

Brief overview of the problem, context and engineering approach to tackle the problem.

## Problem in Context

- 43.6% of rural Ethiopia has no access to electricity.
- **Electrification** and the access to light which it brings has a **positive** impact on the **Human Development Index**.
  - **Education** is the most significantly improved factor of the HDI.
 - Current devices are kerosene lamps, which cause indoor pollution and health risks.

## Engineering Solution

- Solar powered light source for domestic use, to replace Kerosene lamps.
- Affordable and scalable
- Self sufficient product, can be rapidly implemented without new infrastructure requirements.
- Rechargeable battery: does not require grid connection so suitable for rural Ethiopia
- Requirement of 4 hours 40 minutes battery life, to meet local requirements with annually invariant daylight.



# Presentation of the proposal

Technical aspects may be described here.
## Case Design:  
### Key:  
(): Possible but not necessary implementations  
**design constraints in bold**
- **Loop for hanging** (clips for clipping)
- Diffusing transparent plastic cover
- **Slots for the USBs**
- Kick stand to angle the panel perpendicular to sun rays
- Dust resistant (dust covers for the ports)
- **Cheap**
- **3D printable**
- Acyrlic/ PMMA likely material to be used
