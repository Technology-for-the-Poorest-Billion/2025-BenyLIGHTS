Focus on our unique strengths as a team: 
- Noam has the expertise to develop the electronics
- Mechanical engineering of the case is a unique solution that we can contribute, especially diffusion of light
- We bring value in the difficulty of engineers building/fixing the board
- Challenges we face whilst understanding the project are the same as the challenges that will be faced by the engineers in Ethiopia
- Focus on documenting the solutions to challenges that we face, to make the process easier for the engineers in Ethiopia

Look at competitors: D-light
BenyLIGHTs has the advantage of being assembled in Ethiopia, which competitors cannot bring
Cheaper because avoids import tax etc

Things to clarify with Noam:
- Where is the manufacturing happening, is it in China or Ethiopia?
- Ask what is unique compared to D-lights, how this product is different
- Feedback was to focus more on the documentation than the coding
- What to do if we can't get the LED to light up?
- Propose ideas on case and diffuser
