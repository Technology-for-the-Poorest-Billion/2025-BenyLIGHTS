## The assessment of the risks and safety
| Category         | Risk Description                                                                 | Mitigation Strategy                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Electrical**   | Overcharging the battery (Li-ion or LiFePO₄)                                     | Use a charge controller                                                            |
|                  | High voltage from solar panels                                                   | Design for low-voltage systems                                                     |
| **Thermal**      | Overheating due to intense sunlight or LED heat generated                        | Use heat-tolerant materials, ventilation, and heat sinks where needed              |
| **Mechanical**   | Panel or enclosure damage from impact or rough handling                          | Use strong materials to withstand damage                                           |
|                  | Battery puncture or crush leading to fire or failure                             | Use LiFePO₄ cells and shock-resistant battery compartments                         |
| **Environmental**| Water damage from rain or humidity                                               | Use IP65-rated enclosures, gaskets, and weatherproof design                        |
|                  | Dust or insect ingress impacting internal components                             | Use sealed connectors and dust-tight designs                                       |
| **User-related** | Eye damage from bright LEDs                                                      | Use lowest brightness possible for testing, build cover asap                       |
| **Battery**      | Improper disposal or exposure to open flames                                     | Include safety labels and user education on battery handling and disposal          |
