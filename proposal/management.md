#### Week 4
Final changes before project output submission

#### Mechanical
- Produce and assemble final product

#### Electrical
- Explore further improvements on code above and beyond the brief
- Test the discrete boost on the PCB by measuring output voltage using oscilloscope
- Test combined system of WS8212 driven by discrete boost power system



## The assessment of the risks and safety
| Category         | Risk Description                                                                 | Mitigation Strategy                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Electrical**   | Overcharging the battery (Li-ion or LiFePOâ‚„)                                     | Use a charge controller                                                            |
|                  | High voltage from solar panels                                                   | Design for low-voltage systems                                                     |
| **Thermal**      | Overheating due to LED heat generated                                            | Use heat-tolerant materials, ventilation, and heat sinks where needed              |
| **Mechanical**   | Panel or enclosure damage from impact or rough handling                          | Use strong materials to withstand damage                                           |
|                  | Battery puncture or crush leading to fire or failure                             | Handle the boards with care and store in plastic container                         |
| **User-related** | Eye damage from bright LEDs                                                      | Use lowest brightness possible for testing, build cover asap                       |
| **Battery**      | Improper disposal or exposure to open flames                                     | Include safety labels and user education on battery handling and disposal          |



## Contingency plans
- Device already works, so can fall back on this if coding doesn't work
- Can shift the focus to the case
- Electrical mistakes can blow the boards, we have a limited supply
  - Take care when connecting board and make sure there is a control system in place to prevent the boards from blowing
  - Run simulations before connecting the board to identify any possible mistakes
