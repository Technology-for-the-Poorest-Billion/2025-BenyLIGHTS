"Accordingly, raw materials, semi finished goods, producers goods, and import items for public use such as minibuses, buses etc fall under category one. 
Raw materials can be **processed or unprocessed materials** that would be used as industrial or agricultural input while producers' goods are goods such as 
capital goods and others imported by business organization for productive purposes. To encourage business organizations involved in activities such as 
producing goods and services, special privileges are granted to them including the **exemption of customs duty and other taxes**. As a result, raw material, 
and producers goods are largely zero (0) rated although there is up to a 10 percent customs duty rate applied to some of them. For example the importation
of agricultural production inputs such as a tractor is charged with 10 percent customs duty rate. The importation of raw material and producers goods are
**highly encouraged** for they promote domestically produced goods which replace imported goods and helps to save cash flow out of the country. Generally speaking,
the more the imported goods are to be used for productive purpose, the more would get the customs duty rate near to zero.

Semi finished goods are also classified under category one. These goods are imported into the country for **further processing** and their importation is encouraged
next to raw materials and producers goods. ERCA charges semi finished goods at a 10 and 20 percent customs duty rate"

So the PCB being imported from asia will incur low import taxes, this keeps overall product price down with manufacture occuring in ethiopia. 

The case manufacture can be classed as category 1 meaning import taxes will be low also. Further considerations required for comparison between manufacturing in 
asia and shipping vs manufacture in Addis Ababa
