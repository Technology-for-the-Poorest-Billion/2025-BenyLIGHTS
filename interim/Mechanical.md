## Mechanical Interim Report

To be covered (brackets denote who is speaking):
Progress so far - case design (Leo), case modified to be curved (Leo), case printed and tested in the Supersonic Wind Tunnel lab (Leo)
Progress so far - 3D printing issues, supports needing to be removed, weighing up curved vs straight edges, the problem with the extra material (Samuel)
Show prototype so far (Leo)
Update project timeline, and explain what is to come (Samuel)

### Case Design

Several iterations, increasingly complex. Settled on a design with a curved diffuser over the lights to optimise the light diffusion at angles up to 180 degrees.

### Diffusion of Light

Went to supersonic wind tunnel lab, where the blinds could be draw to eliminate light, to test the device.

Used a light meter built into a phone to test the light levels at varying distances.

Diffuser showed good effectiveness, both at reducing the intenisty of light directly ahead of the lights and at increasing the intensity of light at angles perpendicular to the board.

Qualitatively, it was easier to read a book when the diffuser was attached, and shadows has less sharp edges.

### 3D Printing

STL export issues caused parts of the print to invert (fill when they shouldn't, not fill when they should)
