# RGB Code

This is the files needed to light up the RGB LED, which we found on GitHub (this is not our code, we saved it here for future reference). We modified the pins so that it works to light up the RGB LED when it is connected to PD2 (GPIO_Pin_2, Port D) so with some modification it should be easy to change the colour of the LED.
